# MarianMT File Translator v2.3 â€” Fix languages dropdown
- Static files served under /static and explicit GET / for index.html to avoid API route shadowing.
- 15 MB limit, Railway PORT-aware Dockerfile, supports PDF/DOC/DOCX/RTF/TXT.
- JS shows a helpful message if /api/languages fails.

Run locally as before; deploy to Railway via GitHub.
